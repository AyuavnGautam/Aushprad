Medical Waste Management App
An application to resolve the impending dangers of medicinal waste which would focus on reducing medicinal waste at the source point, that is, waste produced by individuals at hospitals and homes.
The application will feature three login sides, namely,

•	USER SIDE
The app will provide user to dispose medicinal waste in the selected categories:
1) Unused Unexpired Medicine : Unused leftover medicines can be returned back to the pharmacies which are featured in the app so that it can be resold.
2) Expired Medicine : These medicines have a lowered potency so they are transferred to NGOs and Pharmaceutical companies to refactor them.
3) Unrecognisable Medicine : These medicines can’t be traced back to their original salt so disposal of these would be done through Dustbin Tracker integrated in the app.
4) Other Medicinal Waste : Waste would be identified by the ML model and mapped into the respective Red, Blue, Green, Yellow colour dustbins.
      
•	DOCTOR SIDE
1) Machine Learning Model : ML model identifies the waste and maps the waste into the Red, Blue, Green, Yellow color dustbins according to the nature of waste.
2) Medical Waste Collector : Hospitals can contact any Medical waste Collector around the city through the app.

•	COLLECTOR SIDE
They are classified into two categories:
1) Medical Waste Collector : Register themselves in the app by providing all the necessary details to get featured in the app.
2) Pharmacies : Register their shops into the app so that the customers can sell them the unused medicines which upon reselling can bag profits.
